# Project Idea

Monitoring what a program does in the backend with os system calls can provide a lot of information.

The basic agenda for this project is to use and implement full features of <sys/ptrace.h> in unix/linux systems 
to create an application which can detect all the system calls made by a given program and print it "beautifully" 
in the terminal with proper explanation.

It would extensively use **core features of C**.

**Future research:** We can train an anomaly detection model to detect and report malwares and other destructive programs.
We can also create patterns of activity that virus or malware make and detect them.
